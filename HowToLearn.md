# How to Learn
when I get to study the big question is how to learn the knowledge, basicall as of an AI age now, the fist idea for me is about to ask AI what his suggestion to help, here are what I found.(I just log down what are the valueable info for me)

# Some Ideas

## Get a learning roadmap
- [Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) is a very interesting space which help to gather the necessary topic which you may need to know as of a specific role learning. and also it provide the ability for you to mark some topic as completed after you have learnt. highly recommended.


## Make up your AI learning Guider
I believe everyone you may have your perfect AI tools, so it can help you to get search to find out the important key knowledges/resources for a given tech term, instead of you to start with scratch. 

what I did started to use is [Kimi](https://www.kimi.com/) which is a free AI tool for personal usage. it have a tool template like **Prompt Expert** can help me to create an effective AI Prompt

Below is the prompt which **Prompt Expert** helped me to create, if you are not satisfied with the prompt you can keep talking to **Kimi Promt Expert** to make it perfect for you.  the best feature I loved is that after you created the prompt pattern, the Kimi also have a feature to allow you to save as a **Keyword/Template** can be used quickly in your everynew talk, and this is also free

## Keep your daily learning
When I started to learn I found it is hard to keep concentration or also keep learning, so I asked AI how to handle this case. here are somem tips I got:
1. Environment Layer – physically isolate the noise
    - Phone
        - Airplane Mode and leave it in another room
        - Use a focus App like a Froest or Tomato App; unlocking the phone equals “mission failed.”
    - Computer
        - Keep only Study program open and log out everything else
    - Desk
        - Only today's book, paper or pens stay in sight.
        - Place a water bottle on the right so that you don't need to stand up often.
        - If it’s noisy, use noise-canceling headphones (white-noise track or silence).
    - People
        - Comunicate with your family so that they don't distrub you in specific learning period.

2. Behavior Layer – slice learning into **“finishable chunks”**
    - Daily “Three Things” List
        Write three micro-goals every morning and stick the note to your monitor. Cross them off visibly—progress bars hack your brain.
    - Task size ≤ 90 min
        Turn “Review Chapter 6” into “Do 5 definite-integral problems” or “Summarize 3 formulas.” Your brain gets a dopamine hit each time you tick a box.
    - Pomodoro 2.0
        - 25 min work + 5 min break (stand, stretch, hydrate).
        - After four cycles, reward yourself with 15 min of phone time or a snack.
        - Use the phone’s built-in timer to avoid extra apps.
3. Mental Layer – reduce the payoff of drifting
    - Spot the trigger
    The instant you feel distracted, ask: Am I tired, anxious, or bored? Jot the reason on a sticky note, acknowledge it, and resume.
    - Two-minute reboot meditation
    Close your eyes, count breaths 1-10. When your mind wanders, gently pull it back. Treat it like Ctrl+Alt+Del, not mysticism.
    - Outsource distractions
    Need to buy shampoo or reply to a text? Dump it onto a “Later” sheet. Promise your brain you’ll batch-process these after the session.
    - Sleep & exercise
    Losing just one hour of sleep cuts glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex by ~15 %.
    Twenty minutes of brisk walking or skipping rope increases BDNF and extends your focus span by roughly 30 %.
4. Advanced – turn focus into a habit
    - Fixed ritual
    Library → plug in headphones → same lo-fi playlist → start Pomodoro. After three weeks, the smell of coffee alone will switch your brain to study mode.
    - Weekly review
    Sunday night, 10 min: count the week’s Pomodoros, list the top three distraction triggers, and pick one tiny tweak for next week (e.g., swap the 250 ml cup for a 500 ml bottle).
    - Accountability buddy
    Open a muted Zoom or Tencent Meeting with one or two friends, cameras on, and study together. Simply having a “virtual deskmate” cuts mind-wandering by ~40 %.
