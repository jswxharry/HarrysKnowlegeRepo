# Harry's Knowlege Repo
This repo is built for recording what ever I self learnt in daily life.  Life is hard, but it's never too late to learn.

# Why to setup this?
When I decided to do this, I recognized that I need to think clearly to understand why. otherwise I belive I will give up in next day. Clearly understood why, is very important to this distance. so let me write up the first draft which can help to push my self.

## Only Knowledge Belong to You
June 5, 2025 is the date, that my employment relationship was terminated by my company, the first company that I have been working 14 years for, in software development area. I made a lot of achievements in the company, thus I was promoted from level 9 to level 13(4 times in this 14 years) But market is really difficult, sine many peole were fired in the same time, thosands people hit into the market. 

I got some rest, and started to look for jobs same as most people is doing, two months, I get two interview opportunities. I screwed up. I failed on the online interviews and another one is the offline interviews. 

online interview: I know these qusetions and how to get the right anwers. but test is the test it don't allow you to leverage addtional resouces. 
offline interview - Interviewer comment: You are a very experienced and nice person, very good in comunicatin, you know many technologies but understanding not deep. 

The Lession I take: there are limited opportunities in the world, and you need to be prepared for. People will label you with subjective biases based on your age and experience, yet the only way to break through all this is to show your knowledge and your smart.

## When You Grows old, Your Memory Decline - The Notes Probabbly Help
Before I taking the inteview, I did tried my best to refresh the tech knowledges in pieces. there are many managed resources in facts which I have learned before or refreshedï¼Œ but when you get into the real interview, I found I still can't pull out the memory. it seems to be the knowledge is not yours but the others' or probabbly I don't have a deep understanding for them. Understand the knowledge, make your summary, extract the principles, and write it down. I don't if it really helps but I'd to have a try. Just like AI equipped with an RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Witness Your Journey
The last resaon, I can think of, while years passed, and if I'm still keeping doing so, how beautiful this repo would be. It contains the entire learning footprint of my life. No matter I can be wealth or not eventually, good or bad. With that I believe I still can tell my self, I have tried hard. Tell my daoughters, your Daddy has tried hard. 
I intent to make this repo as public, so that people can see the journey as well. everybody have the hard time in the life, Study & Excution. Wish everyone can get your own success.

# Reading Tips
In this section I would like put some details how to read from this repo, for the audiance or myself(maybe after long I don't remember this as well)

## Folder Structure
-- notes    --> about what I take notes. it may be not a complete introduction but something I think is worthy to take a note. 

-- notes -- docs    --> the subfolder of the nodes is kind of the classifcation of the conents I start with the Markdown so that I can write my notes in a more beautiful way.
